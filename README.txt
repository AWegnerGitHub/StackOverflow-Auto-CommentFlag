This project is designed to test several different concepts:

 - Flask; This will be my first attempt at using Flask to manage data that is used outside of the main web application. This will be a simple control panel and not much more
 - Machine learning; This will be my first attempt to any machine learning algorithms. The initial attempt will be to use Naive Bayes. If this is successful, I'll look at other algorithms
 - Stack Exchange API; This will be my first attempt at using the SE API
 
Goals of the project:
 
 - Successfully retrieve data from StackExchange's StackOverflow API
 - Successfully write data to StackOverflow via the API
 - Classify training data (StackOverflow comments) into correct type
 - Run test data against training set and receive a high ratio of correctly classified comments. This ratio is not yet defined
 - Implement a Flask control panel which will allow manual insertion of comments via a direct link; manually reclassify comments
 
Higher level goals:

 - Attempt to use different algorithms to learn comment types
